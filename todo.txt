•	At the beginning of the internship, the organization provides credentials in POS systems, online applications, and device access. 
•	It was just the beginning of my learning, and as a result, I faced several difficulties. The first task was to generate a repository as the name of ML models where I should have to push my model for evaluation. 
•	So, I faced a problem connecting the GitHub repository with Visual Studio because of the large size of the csv file. 
•	The organization uses different platforms for collecting data including online food applications, the company's website, and a daily reporting system. 
•	It was hard to catch up with daily goals as an intern, but senior employees helped me to understand processes and task management
•	On the other side, the organization supports learning deeply in Machine learning as they have required it for the future. However, I faced difficulties while creating a flow for the Machine learning course.
•	In technical difficulties, I worked with basic SQL queries with small size of data. 

•	For GitHub, I preferred to watch official guidelines from GitHub which give step by step process for creating GitHub repositories, create Init file, clone repositories, and connect with visual studio by installing GitBash.
I made a different Excel sheet that will handle data for each platform. I collect data from all platforms sequentially which will not merge during the collection process and will be maintained separately. 
I am learning SQL Advance for data migration, which will assist me in migrating data according to organizations' requirements. I did the research for solutions to SQL query problems and found them on StackOverflow.
